#Probability & Earthquakes...is there a connection?

---

I was just contacted by Bill Gates (it is okay to fantasize sometimes, right?). He wants to build the world's tallest building in Canada, which will house Microsoft's largest office center till date. 

During our conversation, we came up with 2 contenders for the location, Toronto and Vancouver. Both cities offer equality in terms of potential target markets, infrastructure, facilities and connectivity among others. 

So, how do we make a decision? Turns out, along with the above-listed factors, there is one that is probably the most critical one! Consider this:

* West coast is a part of "Pacific Ring of Fire" where 90% of world's earthquakes occur. According to Radio Canada, Vancouver is the most at-risk city for a major earthquake in near future, with more than 100 earthquakes (greater than magnitude 5) occurring in last 70 years.
* In comparison, Greater Toronto Area has experienced only about 27 similar events in that time period.
